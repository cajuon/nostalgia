‘Nostalgia’ is a website for an online based in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.

1. Project Description
   What is the first thing you have in mind when the nostalgia word come out? Of course, we tend to remember the past especially the beautiful moment that we surely cannot get rid of. As for us, the 2000’s kid or more known as the generation Z, we played a lot of games that is unique and have its own rules that need to be abided. For example, we have “Ceper” (bottle cap), “Gasing” (top), Eraser brawl, Clap Card, Yoyo, B-Daman and Bakugan. Apparently, some of games that we played are inspired from traditional games or from “Anime”.
   Our project intends to reminisce our wonderful childhood memories, playing games with our friends. We want society to relive these past moments, because all the little games once make us smile. This website helps us to accomplish our objective by spreading information about the games to the society. Our website also will be a place for people with same interest to gather. We provide a section for them to interact with each other.
